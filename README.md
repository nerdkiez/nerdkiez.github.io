# Nerdkiez website


Hosting our website using github pages.



The site is running on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

To get this up and running locally be sure to have Ruby > 2.5.0 running

```zsh
gem install --user-install bundler jekyll
```

Then bundle it

```bash
bundle
```

Serve it locally to port 4200 with 

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve  
```





If you want to update the dependancies run

```bash
bundle update
```

And then install

```bash
bundle install
```
