This is the seconnd wheat beer we are brewing. This time, we try to make it a bit lighter and simpler.


## Ingredients

21L Mash water

12L Sparge water

Again, of course we had to use the classic, hard Berlin tap water.

Tip: A bike cargo trailer makes it easy to transport hot sparge water to the park! :)


### Fermentable's


- 2.23 kg Wheat malt - 3-5 EBC
- 1.72 kg Pilsner malt - 2.5-4.5 EBC
- 0.3 kg Cara wheat - 110-140 EBC

The Cara was maybe a bit too much and we ended up with a darker result as inteded. Note to our future selfs: Use Cara hell or just less Cara.


### Hops / flavoring

Total boiling time is 90 minutes from hot break.

|Hop                                      |Amount| Time to finish |
|-----------------------------------------|------|----------------|
|Hallertau mittelfrueh (alpha ~ 4.9%)     |22g   |60 min          |
|Hallertau mittelfrueh (alpha ~ 4.9%)     |8g   |15 min          |



## Brewing


|       |         |        |
|-------|---------|--------|
|Mash in  | 50°C    |20 min|
|Protein rest|55°C  |15 min| 
|Maltose rest|65°C  |35 min|
|Sugar rest|72°C    |20 min|
|Mash out  |78°C    |20 min|


We ended up with an Original Gravity (OG) of 1.050 after the boil.

I also wanted to give a little insight about how we brew: We use the _"brew it a bag"_-Method for a while now. We also found that for us, lautering works best if we take the whole grain bag out of the brew kettle and wash it in a sparge water bucket. It's (relatively) clean, it's simple, it's effective.

## Fermentation

yeast: WB-08

Temperature at around ~ 18C

After 17 days of fermentation in our blue bucket fermenter, we ended up with a Final Gravity (FG) of 1.030. This measurements would give a final alcohol content of just 2.63% ABV.



## Bottle Day!

We have added 6g of priming sugar for each 0.5 liter botte to get a nice, bubbly beer with lots of CO2. 



## Brewer's tip

cool down for about 12 hours overnight in the basement with lid on.
