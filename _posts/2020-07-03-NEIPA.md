This recipe is perfect to impress ale lovers and is very easy to replicate.
We originally wanted to use pale ale malt but decided to go for pilsner extra light malt for flavoring and added some _cara red_ for the color.
We ended up with a fresh orange juice color beer. I hope someone took a photo of the final results - otherwise we'll just brew it again. 
Here's the recipe:


## Ingredients

- 20L Mash 
- 10L Sparge

We used Berlin tap water which is considered medium hard to hard (14 °dH).

### Fermentables

Todays fermentable were eyeballed pretty hard. We bought the ingredients for a 30L mash in but only want 20L due to brew pot capacity. Therefor we estimated 2/3 of our ingredients.

- 3.6 kg Pilsener extra light
- 800 g Wheat malt light
- 666 g Cara red malt
- 470 g Vienna malt
- 333 g Oats

### Hops / flavoring

Total boiling time is 90 minutes from hot break. The reason why we don't boil the hops is that we want to give our beer a nice bitter aroma.

| Hop                  | Amount | Time to finish |
| -------------------- | ------ | -------------- |
| Mosaic (12,5% Alpha) | 20 g   | 0 min          |
| Citra (13,1% Alpha)  | 20 g   | 0 min          |
| Hallertau ( % Alpha) | 22 g   | 0 min          |



Dry hopping:  
To add citrus aroma, we are adding 2 batches of hops to the fermeter. The first addition is on day one while fermentation is very active.
The second addition is roughly at day 5 where the fermentation activity is already much lower.


| Hop |Amount | Time after boil|
| -------------------- | ----- | -------------- |
| Mosaic (12,5% Alpha) | 10     | ~1 day         |
| Citra (13,1% Alpha)  | 13,5   | ~1 day         |
| Mosaic (12,5% Alpha) | 10     | ~5 day         |
| Citra (13,1% Alpha)  | 13,5   | ~5 day         |

| Mash out             | 78°C        |              |

## Fermentation

Fermentation takes about 7 to 8 days at 18°C.

## Brewer's tip
Sometimes science is more art than science.
