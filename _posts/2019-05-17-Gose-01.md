![Brewing it](/assets/gose_brewing.jpeg)

## Description

> Gose is a warm fermented beer that originated in Goslar, Germany. 
> It is usually brewed with at least 50% of the grain bill being malted wheat. [source Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gose)

Gose a sour beer with a strong acicdity and herbal notes which makes it a perfect summer beer.

This recipe is inspired by an old recipe in "Grundsätze der Bierbrauerei nach den neuesten technisch-chemischen
Entdeckungen" by Christian Heinrich Schmidt from 1853 (pages 447-448) which we found at https://barclayperkins.blogspot.com/2010/07/gose-recipe.html

## Ingredients

10L Mash

8L Sparge

We used Berlin tap water which is considered medium hard to hard (14 °dH).


### Fermentables

- 900g Pilner Malt
- 1kg Wheat Malt
- 350g Sour Malt

### Hops / flavoring

Total boiling time is 90 minutes from hot break.

Here are the hop and spice additions. We decided to add salt and coriander for the herbal flavour 10 minutes before the end of boiling. Also, untypically, we added additional hops for more bitterness.

|Hop                 |Amount              | Time to finish |
|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|
|Hallertau           | 14g                |80 min          |
|Spalter select      |4g                  |10 min          |
|Salt                |9,5g                |10min           |
|Coriander           |9,5g                |10min           |



## Brewing

We decided to go with a _single temperature infusion_ at 65°C. This should result in a rather dry beer.

|       |         |        |
|-------|---------|--------|
|Mash in| 45°C    |        |
|Combi rest| 64°C |85 min |
|Mash out         |78°C   ||

## Fermentation

Salafe S-05 (dry).

Fermentation takes about 10 - 12 days at 18°C. Eventual second fermentation to clear the beer. (To be decided)

Since we are too lazy to ferment with lactobacillus bacteria, we will add lactic acid berfore bottling.
Next time, we will try it with an actual Lactic acid fermentation.

## Comments

First measurement revealed 1,035 gravity just before the hotbreak.

OG: 1,045 - Note: OG for Gose shoud be between 1,035 and 1,056
FG: To be measured.

## Brewer's tip
