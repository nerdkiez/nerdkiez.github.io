First time brewed: 03 July 2020

## Description

### Aim

Have a very heavy New England IPA.
As the Pale ale malt was out, we used Pils extra light malt for flavoring and added some Carared for fancy color.
Hoping for a kind of fresh pulpy orange juice color.

### Result

This will be updated when we drink the batch.

## Ingredients

~20L Mash -> roughly calculated by measuring width and hight of pot

10L Sparge

We used Berlin tap water which is considered medium hard to hard (14 °dH).

### Fermentables

Todays fermentable were eyeballed pretty hard. We bought the ingredients for a 30L mash in but only want 20L due to brew pot capacity. Therefor we estimated 2/3 of our ingredients.

- 3.6 kg Pilsener extra light
- 800 g Wheat malt light
- 666 g Carared malt
- 470 g Vienna malt
- 333 g Oats

### Hops / flavoring

Total boiling time is 90 minutes from hot break.

| Citra (13,1% Alpha)  | 20 g   | 0 min          |

| Mash out      | 78°C        |              |
